 Identifier: A Link Relation to Convey a Preferred URI for Referencing
                    draft-vandesompel-identifier-00

Abstract

   This specification defines a link relation type that is intended to
   convey that a URI, other than the URI that provides a link with the
   relation type, is preferred for the purpose of referencing.

1.  Introduction

   A web resource is routinely referenced (e.g. linked, bookmarked) by
   means of the URI where it is directly accessed.  But cases exist
   whereby referencing a resource by means of a different URI is
   preferred, for example because the latter URI is intended to be more
   persistent over time.  Currently, there is no way to convey such
   alternative referencing preferences; this specification introduces a
   link relation type intended for that purpose.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft             Identifier Relation                 July 2017


   This specification uses the terms "link context" and "link target" as
   defined in [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis].  Both "link context" and
   "link target" are defined as IRIs but in common scenarios are also
   URIs.

   Additionally, for clarity, this specification uses the following
   terms:

   o  "access URI": A URI at which a user agent accesses a web resource.

   o  "reference URI": A URI, other than the access URI, that should
      preferentially be used for referencing.

   By interacting with the access URI, the user agent may discover typed
   links.  For such links, the access URI is the link context.

3.  Scenarios

3.1.  Persistent Identifiers

   Despite sound advice regarding the design of Cool URIs [CoolURIs],
   link rot ("HTTP 404 Not Found") is a common phenomena when following
   links on the web.  Certain communities of practice have introduced a
   solution to combat this problem that typically consists of:

   o  Accepting the reality that the web location of a resource - the
      access URI - may change over time.

   o  Minting an additional URI for the resource - the reference URI -
      that is specifically intended to remain persistent over time.

   o  Redirecting (typically "HTTP 301 Moved Permanently", "HTTP 302
      Found", or "HTTP 303 See Other") from the reference URI to the
      access URI.

   o  As a community, committing to adjust that redirection whenever the
      access URI changes over time.

   This approach is, for example, used by:

   o  Scholalry publishers that use DOIs [DOIs] to identify articles and
      DOI URLs [DOI-URLs] as a means to keep cross-publisher article-to-
      article links operational, even when the journals in which the
      articles are published change hands from one publisher to another,
      for example, as a result of an acquisition.

Internet-Draft             Identifier Relation                 July 2017


   o  Authors of controlled vocabularies that use PURLs [PURLs] for
      vocabulary terms to ensure that the term URIs remain stable even
      if management of the vocabulary is transfered to a new custodian.

   o  A variety of organizations, including libraries, archives, and
      museums that assign ARK URLs [draft-kunze-ark-18] to information
      objects in order to support long-term access.

   In order for the investments in infrastructure involved in these
   approaches to pay off, and hence for links to effectively remain
   operational as intended, it is crucial that a resource be referenced
   by means of its reference URI.  However, the access URI is where a
   user agent actually accesses the resource (e.g. it is the URI in the
   browser's address bar).  As such, there is a considerable risk that
   the access URI instead of the reference URI is used for referencing
   [PIDs-must-be-used].

   The link relation type defined in this specification allows to convey
   to user agents that the reference URI is the preferred URI for
   referencing.  Applications such as bookmarking tools, citation
   managers, and webometrics can take this preference into account when
   recording a URI.

3.2.  Preferred Social Identifier

   A web user commonly has mutliple profiles on the web, for example,
   one per social network she takes part in, a personal homepage, a
   professional homepage, a FOAF profile [FOAF], etc.  Each of these
   profiles is accessible at a distinct URI.  But the user may have a
   preference for one of those profiles, for example, because it is most
   complete, kept up-to-date, or expected to be long-lived.

   The link relation type defined in this specification allows to convey
   to user agents that a profile URI - the reference URI - other than
   the one the agent is accessing - the access URI - is preferred for
   referencing.

3.3.  Multi-Resource Publications

   When publishing on the web, it is not uncommon to make distinct
   components of a publication available as different web resources,
   each with their own URI.  For example:

   o  Contemporary scholarly publications routinely consists of a
      traditional article as well as additional materials that are
      considered an integral part of the publication such as
      supplementary information, high-resolution images, a video
      recording of an experiment.

Internet-Draft             Identifier Relation                 July 2017


   o  Scientific or governmental open data sets frequently consist of
      multiple files.

   o  Online books typically consist of multiple chapters.

   While each of these components are accessible at their distinct URI -
   the access URI - they often also share a URI assinged to the
   intellectual publication of which they are components - the reference
   URI.

   The link relation type defined in this specification allows to convey
   to user agents that, for the purpose of referencing, the reference
   URI of the intellectual publication is preferred over an access URI
   of a component of the publication.

4.  The "identifier" Relation Type for Expressing a Preferred URI for
    the Purpose of Referencing

   A link with the "identifier" relation type indicates that the link
   target is preferred over the link context for the purpose of
   referencing.

   It is RECOMMENDED for reference URIs to support protocol-based access
   as a means to ensure that applications that store reference URIs can
   effectively re-use them for access.

   Because a link with the "identifier" relation type expresses a
   preferred URI for the purpose of referencing, the access URI SHOULD
   only provide one link with that relation type.  If more than one
   "identifier" link is provided, the user agent may decide to select
   one (e.g. an HTTP URI over a mailto URI), for example, based on the
   purpose that the reference URI will serve.

   Providing a link with the "identifier" relation type does not prevent
   using the access URI for the purpose of referencing if such
   specificity is needed for the application at hand.  For example, in
   the case of scenario Section 3.3 the access URI is likely required
   for the purpose of annotating a specific component of an intellectual
   publication.  Yet, the annotation application may also want to
   appropriately include the reference URI, e.g. using the "canonical"
   relation defined in the Web Annotation Data Model
   [W3C.REC-annotation-model-20170223].

5.  Distinction with Other Relation Types

   The following existing IANA-registered relationships are similar to
   the relationship that "identifier" is intended to convey, but are not
   appropriate for various reasons:



Van de Sompel, et al.   Expires January 12, 2018                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             Identifier Relation                 July 2017


   o  "alternate" [RFC4287], used to link to an alternate version of the
      content at the Context IRI, for example the same content with
      varying Content-Type (e.g., application/pdf vs. text/html) and/or
      Content-Language (e.g., en vs. fr).

   o  "bookmark" [W3C.REC-html5-20151028], used to convey a permanent
      link to use for bookmarking purposes.

   o  "canonical" [RFC6596], used to identify content that is either
      duplicative or a superset of the content at the Context IRI, for
      example a single page version of a magazine article, provided for
      indexing by search engines, of an article that is spread over
      several pages for human use.

   o  "duplicate" [RFC6249], used to link to a resource whose available
      representations are byte-for-byte identical with the corresponding
      representations of the context IRI, for example, an identical file
      on a mirror site.

   o  "related" [RFC4287], used to link to a related resource.

   A closer inspection of these candidates [identifier-blog] shows that
   they are not appropriate and that a new relation type is required.

   In the scenario of Section 3.1 there is no content available at the
   reference URI as it merely redirects to the access URI.  In the
   scenario of Section 3.2, the content at the reference URI is a
   profile that is different than the profile at the access URI.  In
   scenario of Section 3.3 the content at the reference URI, if any,
   would typcially be a sort of table of contents page with links to
   component resources and possibly a summary.  These considerations
   exclude "alternate", "canonical", and "duplicate" as possible
   relation types.

   The intent of "bookmark" is closest related to that of "identifier"
   in that the Target IRI of a link with this relation type is intended
   for bookmarking, which is a case of referencing.  However, "bookmark"
   is specifically defined for use in conjunction with the HTML
   <article> element and is explictly excluded from use in the <link>
   element in HTML <head>.  Since a link in <link> and one in the HTTP
   Link header are semantically equivalent, "bookmark" is also excluded
   from use in HTTP Link.

   While "related" could be used, its semantics are too vague to convey
   the specific nature of "identifier" as a means to convey a URI for
   the purpose of referencing.

6.  Examples

   Sections Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 show examples of the use of
   links with the "identifier" relation type.  One example shows its use
   in a response header and body, the other in a response body only.

6.1.  Persistent HTTP URI

   If the access URI is a landing page for a scholarly article for which
   the persistent HTTP URI <http://persistence.example.org/738207472>
   was minted, then the response to an HTTP GET on the landing page's
   URI could be as shown in Figure 1.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Link: <http://persistence.example.org/738207472> ; rel="identifier"
Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8

<html>
 <head>
 ...
  <link rel="identifier" href="http://persistence.example.org/738207472" />
 ...
 </head>
 <body>
  ...
 </body>
</html>

                             scholarly article

6.2.  Preferred Profile URI

   If the access URI is the home page of John Doe, John can add a link
   with the "identifier" relation type to it, as a means to convey that
   he would preferably be referenced by means of the URI of his FOAF
   profile.  Figure 2 shows the response to an HTTP GET on the URI of
   John's home page.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Link Relation Type: identifier

   The link relation type below has been registered by IANA per
   Section 2.1.1 of [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis]:

      Relation Name: identifier

      Description: A link with the "identifier" relation type indicates
      that the link target is preferred over the link context for the
      purpose of referencing.

      Reference: [[ This document ]]

8.  Security Considerations

   A site might use the "identifier" link relation with inaccurate or
   misleading information about which URI to use for referencing.  Since
   cases exist in which it may not be possible to automatically verify
   the correctness of the reference URI, out-of-band mechanisms might be
   required to establish trust.

   If a trusted site is compromised, the "identifier" link relation
   could be used with malicious intent to supply misleading URIs for
   referencing.  Use of these links might direct user agents to an
   attacker's site, break the referencing record they are intended to
   support, or corrupt algorithmic interpretation of referencing data.
