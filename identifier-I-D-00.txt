 Identifier: A Link Relation to Convey a Preferred URI for Referencing
                    draft-vandesompel-identifier-00

Abstract

   This specification defines a link relation type that is intended to
   convey that a URI, other than the URI that provides a link with the
   relation type, is preferred for the purpose of referencing.

1.  Introduction

   A web resource is routinely referenced (e.g. linked, bookmarked) by
   means of the URI where it is directly accessed.  But cases exist
   whereby referencing a resource by means of a different URI is
   preferred, for example because the latter URI is intended to be more
   persistent over time.  Currently, there is no way to convey such
   alternative referencing preferences; this specification introduces a
   link relation type intended for that purpose.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft             Identifier Relation                 July 2017


   This section introduces two types of URIs for a web resource:

   o  "actual URI": An actionable URI at which a user agent accesses a
      web resource.

   o  "identifying URI": An actionable URI, other than the actual URI,
      that should preferentially be used for referencing (e.g. linking,
      bookmarking).

   Here "actionable" means that protocol-based read access to the
   resource identified by the URI is possible.  For example, an HTTP URI
   is actionable because read access is possible by issuing an HTTP HEAD
   or GET request against the URI.

3.  Scenarios

3.1.  Persistent Identifiers

   Despite sound advice regarding the design of Cool URIs [CoolURIs],
   link rot ("HTTP 404 Not Found") is a common phenomena when following
   links on the web.  Certain communities of practice have introduced a
   solution to combat this problem that typically consists of:

   o  Accepting the reality that the web location of a resource - the
      actual URI - may change over time.

   o  Minting an additional URI for the resource - the identififying URI
      - that is specifically intended to remain persistent over time.

   o  Redirecting (typically "HTTP 301 Moved Permanently", "HTTP 302
      Found", or "HTTP 303 See Other") from the identififying URI to the
      actual URI.

   o  As a community, committing to adjust that redirection whenever the
      actual URI changes over time.

   This approach is, for example, used by:

   o  Scholalry publishers that use DOIs [DOIs] to identify articles and
      DOI URLs [DOI-URLs] as a means to keep cross-publisher article-to-
      article links operational, even when the journals in which the
      articles are published change hands from one publisher to another,
      for example, as a result of an acquisition.

   o  Authors of controlled vocabularies that use PURLs [PURLs] for
      vocabulary terms to ensure that the term URIs remain stable even
      if management of the vocabulary is transfered to a new custodian.

Internet-Draft             Identifier Relation                 July 2017


   o  A variety of organizations, including libraries, archives, and
      museums that assign ARK URLs [draft-kunze-ark-18] to information
      objects in order to support long-term access.

   In order for the investments in infrastructure involved in these
   approaches to pay off, and hence for links to effectively to remain
   operational as intended, it is crucial that a resource be referenced
   by means of its identifying URI.  However, the actual URI is where a
   user agent actually accesses the resource (e.g. it is the URI in the
   browser's address bar).  As such, there is a considerable risk that
   the actual URI instead of the identifying URI is used for referencing
   [PIDs-must-be-used].

   The link relation type defined in this specification allows to convey
   to user agents that the identifying URI is the preferred URI for
   referencing.  Applications such as bookmarking tools, citation
   managers, and webometrics can take this preference into account when
   recording a URI.

3.2.  Preferred Social Identifier

   A web user commonly has mutliple profiles on the web, for example,
   one per social network she takes part in, a personal homepage, a
   professional homepage, a FOAF profile [FOAF], etc.  Each of these
   profiles is accessible at a distinct URI.  But the user may have a
   preference for one of those profiles, for example, because it is most
   complete, kept up-to-date, or expected to be long-lived.

   The link relation type defined in this specification allows to convey
   to user agents that a profile URI - the identifying URI - other than
   the one the agent is accessing - the actual URI - is preferred for
   referencing.

3.3.  Multi-Resource Publications

   When publishing on the web, it is not uncommon to make distinct
   components of a publication available as different web resources,
   each with their own URI.  For example:

   o  Contemporary scholarly publications routinely consists of a
      traditional article as well as additional materials that are
      considered an integral part of the publication such as
      supplementary information, high-resolution images, a video
      recording of an experiment.

   o  Scientific or governmental open data sets frequently consist of
      multiple files.

Internet-Draft             Identifier Relation                 July 2017


   o  Online books typically consist of multiple chapters.

   While each of these components are accessible at their distinct URI -
   the actual URI - they often also share a URI assinged to the
   intellectual publication of which they are components - the
   identifying URI.

   The link relation type defined in this specification allows to convey
   to user agents that, for the purpose of referencing, the identifying
   URI of the intellectual publication is preferred over an actual URI
   of a component of the publication.

4.  The "identifier" Relation Type for Expressing a Preferred URI for
    the Purpose of Referencing

   A link with the "identifier" relation type indicates that the Target
   IRI - the identifying URI - is preferred over the Context IRI - the
   actual URI - for the purpose of referencing.

   Because a link with the "identifier" relation type expresses a
   preferred URI for the purpose of referencing, the actual URI SHOULD
   only provide one link with that relation type.

   Providing a link with the "identifier" relation type does not prevent
   using the actual URI for the purpose of referencing if such
   specificity is needed for the application at hand.  For example, in
   the case of scenario Section 3.3 the actual URI is likely required
   for the purpose of annotating a specific component of an intellectual
   publication.  Yet, the annotation application may also want to
   include a reference to the identifying URI.

5.  Distinction with Other Relation Types

   The following existing IANA-registered relationships are similar to
   the relationship that "identifier" is intended to convey, but are not
   appropriate for various reasons:

   o  "alternate" [RFC4287], used to link to an alternate version of the
      content at the Context IRI, for example the same content with
      varying Content-Type (e.g., application/pdf vs. text/html) and/or
      Content-Language (e.g., en vs. fr).

   o  "bookmark" [W3C.REC-html5-20151028], used to convey a permanent
      link to use for bookmarking purposes.

   o  "canonical" [RFC6596], used to identify content that is either
      duplicative or a superset of the content at the Context IRI, for
      example a single page version of a magazine article, provided for

Internet-Draft             Identifier Relation                 July 2017


      indexing by search engines, of an article that is spread over
      several pages for human use.

   o  "duplicate" [RFC6249], used to link to a resource whose available
      representations are byte-for-byte identical with the corresponding
      representations of the context IRI, for example, an identical file
      on a mirror site.

   o  "related" [RFC4287], used to link to a related resource.

   A closer inspection of these candidates [identifier-blog] shows that
   they are not appropriate and that a new relation type is required.

   In the scenario of Section 3.1 there is no content available at the
   identifying URI as it merely redirects to the actual URI.  In the
   scenario of Section 3.2, the content at the identifying URI is a
   profile that is different than the profile at the actual URI.  In
   scenario of Section 3.3 the content at the identifying URI, if any,
   would typcially be a sort of table of contents page with links to
   component resources and possibly a summary.  These considerations
   exclude "alternate", "canonical", and "duplicate" as possible
   relation types.

   The intent of "bookmark" is closest related to that of "identifier"
   in that the Target IRI of a link with this relation type is intended
   for bookmarking, which is a case of referencing.  However, "bookmark"
   is specifically defined for use in conjunction with the HTML
   <article> element and is explictly excluded from use in the <link>
   element in HTML <head>.  Since a link in <link> and one in the HTTP
   Link header are semantically equivalent, "bookmark" is also excluded
   from use in HTTP Link.

   While "related" could be used, its semantics are too vague to convey
   the specific nature of "identifier" as a means to convey a URI for
   the purpose of referencing.

6.  Examples

   Sections Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 show examples of the use of
   links with the "identifier" relation type.  One example shows its use
   in a response header and body, the other in a response body only.

6.1.  Persistent HTTP URI

   If the context resource is a landing page for a scholarly article for
   which the persistent HTTP URI
   <http://persistence.example.org/738207472> was minted, then the

   response to an HTTP GET on the landing page's URI could be as shown
   in Figure 1.

 </body>
</html>

                             scholarly article

6.2.  Preferred Profile URI

   If the context resource is the home page of John Doe, John can add a
   link with the "identifier" relation type to it, as a means to convey
   that he would preferably be referenced by means of the URI of his
   FOAF profile.  Figure 2 shows the response to an HTTP GET on the URI
   of John's home page.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8

<html>
 <head>
 ...
  <link rel="identifier" href="http://johndoe.example.com/foaf" type="txt/ttl"/>
 ...
 </head>
 <body>
  ...
 </body>
</html>

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Link Relation Type: identifier

   The link relation type below has been registered by IANA per
   Section 6.2.1 of [RFC5988]:

      Relation Name: identifier

      Description: A link with the "identifier" relation type that
      points from a Context IRI to a target IRI indicates that the
      Target IRI is preferred over the Context IRI for the purpose of
      referencing.
