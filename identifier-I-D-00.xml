        <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
            <t>A web resource is routinely referenced (e.g. linked, bookmarked) by means of the URI where it is 
                directly accessed. But cases exist whereby referencing 
                a resource by means of a different URI is preferred, for example because the latter URI 
                is intended to be more persistent over time. Currently, there is no way to convey such  
                alternative referencing preferences; this specification introduces a link relation type 
                intended for that purpose.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">
            <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
            <t>This section introduces two types of URIs for a web resource:</t>
            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>&quot;actual URI&quot;: An actionable URI at which a user agent accesses a web resource. 
                </t>
                <t>&quot;identifying URI&quot;: An actionable URI, other than the actual URI,  
                    that should preferentially be used for referencing (e.g. linking, bookmarking).</t>
            </list></t>  
            <t>Here &quot;actionable&quot; means that protocol-based read access to the resource identified by the URI 
                is possible. For example, an HTTP URI is actionable because read access is possible by issuing 
                an HTTP HEAD or GET request against the URI.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Scenarios" anchor="scenarios">
            <section title="Persistent Identifiers" anchor="PIDs">
            <t>Despite sound advice regarding the design of Cool URIs <xref target="CoolURIs"/>, 
                link rot (&quot;HTTP 404 Not Found&quot;) is a common phenomena when following links on 
                the web. Certain communities of practice have introduced a solution to combat this problem  
                that typically consists of:</t>
            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Accepting the reality that the web location of a resource - the actual URI - may change 
                    over time.</t>
                <t>Minting an additional URI for the resource - the identififying URI - that is specifically 
                    intended to remain persistent over time.</t>
                <t>Redirecting (typically &quot;HTTP 301 Moved Permanently&quot;, &quot;HTTP 302 Found&quot;, 
                    or &quot;HTTP 303 See Other&quot;) from the identififying URI to the actual URI.</t>
                <t>As a community, committing to adjust that redirection whenever the actual URI changes 
                    over time.</t>
            </list></t>
            <t>This approach is, for example, used by:</t>
            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Scholalry publishers that use DOIs <xref target="DOIs"/> to identify articles and DOI URLs 
                    <xref target="DOI-URLs"/> as a means to keep cross-publisher article-to-article links 
                    operational, even when the journals in which the articles are published change hands from 
                    one publisher to another, for example, as a result of an acquisition.</t>
                <t>Authors of controlled vocabularies that use PURLs <xref target="PURLs"/> for vocabulary 
                    terms to ensure that the term URIs remain stable even if management of the vocabulary is 
                    transfered to a new custodian.</t>
                <t>A variety of organizations, including libraries, archives, and museums that assign ARK URLs 
                    <xref target="draft-kunze-ark-18"/> to information objects in order to support long-term 
                    access.</t>
            </list></t>
                <t>In order for the investments in infrastructure involved in these approaches to pay off, 
                and hence for links to effectively to remain operational as intended, it is crucial that a resource 
                be referenced by means of its identifying URI. However, the actual URI is where 
                a user agent actually accesses the resource (e.g. it is the URI in the browser's address bar). 
                As such, there is a considerable risk that the actual URI instead of the identifying URI 
                is used for referencing <xref target="PIDs-must-be-used"/>.</t>
                <t>The link relation type defined in this specification allows to 
                convey to user agents that the identifying URI is the preferred URI for referencing. 
                Applications such as bookmarking tools, citation managers, and webometrics can take this preference 
                into account when recording a URI.

            <section title="Preferred Social Identifier" anchor="ORCID">
                <t>A web user commonly has mutliple profiles on the web, for example, 
                    one per social network she takes part in, 
                    a personal homepage, a professional homepage, a FOAF profile <xref target="FOAF"/>, etc. 
                    Each of these profiles is accessible at a distinct URI. But the user may 
                    have a preference for one of those profiles, for example, because it is most complete, 
                    kept up-to-date, or expected to be long-lived.          
                </t>
                <t>The link relation type defined in this specification allows to convey to user agents that 
                a profile URI - the identifying URI - other than the one the agent is 
                accessing - the actual URI - is preferred for referencing.</t>

            <section title="Multi-Resource Publications" anchor="ORE">
                <t>When publishing on the web, it is not uncommon to make distinct components of a 
                publication available as different web resources, each with their own URI. For example:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Contemporary scholarly publications routinely consists of a 
                traditional article as well as additional materials that are considered an integral part of the 
                publication such as supplementary information, high-resolution images, a video recording 
                of an experiment.</t>
               <t>Scientific or governmental open data sets frequently consist of multiple files.</t>
               <t>Online books typically consist of multiple chapters.</t>
                </list></t>
                <t>While each of these components are accessible at their distinct URI - the actual URI - they often also 
                share a URI assinged to the intellectual publication of which they are components - the identifying URI.</t> 
                <t>The link relation type defined in this specification allows to 
                convey to user agents that, for the purpose of referencing, the identifying URI of the intellectual publication  
                is preferred over an actual URI of a component of the publication.

        <section title="The &quot;identifier&quot; Relation Type for Expressing a Preferred URI for the Purpose of Referencing" anchor="identifier-link-relation">
            <t>A link with the "identifier" relation type indicates that the Target IRI - the identifying URI - is preferred over 
                the Context IRI - the actual URI - for the purpose of referencing.</t>
            <t>Because a link with the "identifier" relation type expresses a preferred URI for the purpose of 
                referencing, the actual URI SHOULD only provide one link with that relation type.</t> 
            <t>Providing a link with the "identifier" relation type does not prevent using the actual URI 
                for the purpose of referencing if such specificity is needed for the application at hand.  
                For example, in the case of scenario <xref target="ORE"/> the actual URI is likely required for the 
                purpose of annotating a specific component of an intellectual publication. Yet, the annotation application 
                may also want to include a reference to the identifying URI.</t>

        <section title="Distinction with Other Relation Types" anchor="other-relations">
            <t>The following existing IANA-registered relationships are similar to the relationship that 
                "identifier" is intended to convey, but are not appropriate for various reasons:</t>
            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>"alternate" <xref target="RFC4287"/>, used to link to an alternate version of 
                    the content at the Context IRI, for example the same content with varying 
                    Content-Type (e.g., application/pdf vs. text/html) and/or Content-Language 
                    (e.g., en vs. fr).
                </t>
                <t>"bookmark" <xref target="W3C.REC-html5-20151028"/>, used to convey a 
                    permanent link to use for bookmarking purposes.
                </t>
                <t>"canonical" <xref target="RFC6596"/>, used to identify content that is 
                    either duplicative or a superset of the content at the Context IRI, 
                    for example a single page version of a magazine article, provided
                    for indexing by search engines, of an article that is spread over 
                    several pages for human use.
                </t>
                <t>"duplicate" <xref target="RFC6249"/>, used to link to a resource whose 
                    available representations are byte-for-byte identical with the 
                    corresponding representations of the context IRI, for example, 
                    an identical file on a mirror site.
                </t>
                <t>"related" <xref target="RFC4287"/>, used to link to a related resource.
                </t>
            </list></t>
            <t>A closer inspection of these candidates <xref target="identifier-blog"/> shows 
                that they are not appropriate and that a new relation type is required.</t>
                    <t>In the scenario of <xref target="PIDs"/> there is no content available 
                        at the identifying URI as it merely redirects to the actual URI. 
                        In the scenario of <xref target="ORCID"/>, the content at the 
                        identifying URI is a profile that is different than the profile at the 
                        actual URI. In scenario of <xref target="ORE"/> the 
                        content at the identifying URI, if any, would typcially be a sort of 
                        table of contents page with links to component resources and possibly 
                        a summary. These considerations exclude "alternate", 
                        "canonical", and "duplicate" as possible relation types.</t>
                    <t>The intent of "bookmark" is closest related to that of "identifier" 
                        in that the Target IRI of a link with this relation type is intended for 
                        bookmarking, which is a case of referencing. However, "bookmark" 
                        is specifically defined for use in conjunction with the HTML 
                        &lt;article&gt; element and is explictly excluded from use in the 
                        &lt;link&gt; element in HTML &lt;head&gt;. Since a link in 
                        &lt;link&gt; and one in the HTTP Link header are semantically equivalent, 
                        "bookmark" is also excluded from use in HTTP Link.
                    </t>
                    <t>While "related" could be used, its semantics are too vague 
                    to convey the specific nature of "identifier" as a means to 
                    convey a URI for the purpose of referencing.</t>
